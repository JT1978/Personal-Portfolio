# Personal-Portfolio

## Working With CSS Challenge: Portfolio

Build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresses.

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it.

Acceptance Criteria
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you

When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications

When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others

When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application

When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

Collab with Alexandra Batrak and Sean Howe both helped me sorting out different issues I was having with backgrounds getting them lined up properly and also HTML code which needed adjusted.
